##OpenFlow

###What is OpenFlow?
OpenFlow is a free messenger, insprired by Microsoft's Announcement of "Flow", a messenger designed around E-Mail for transport. Flow is limited to Exchange, whereas OpenFlow is supposed to work with any mail system in the world.

###Advantages
- No closed ecosystem
Any mail client can be used to write messages for OpenFlow. One could write a plugin for Thunderbird, Outlook or even a webmailer. You cannot lose your contacts or your mails, just because the owner of the system decides to pull the plug. 
- Free and open standards
No single entity owns intellectual property or keeps specifications secret.
- Global community
Any mail address (provided it can do IMAP, although POP3 would be possibl in theory) can be used, so there is no need to create a new account.
- Flexibility
Encryption can easily be added on top of the messages.

###Disadvantages
- Delivery time
E-Mail does not have a guaranteed delivery time, as such OpenFlow is not an "instant" messenger. You messages may reach the other side in a matter of milliseconds or minutes, there is no way to tell. Delivery time depends entirely on your mail provided.
